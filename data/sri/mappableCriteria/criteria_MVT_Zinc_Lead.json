A conclusion from Leach and others \n(2005) was that no special rock type stood out as a preferred \nsource.

In addition, the higher \npyrite content generates greater amounts of sulfuric acid, and \nlocal low-pH conditions at mineral surfaces dissolve greater \nquantities of the primary sulfides and their contained trace \nelements.

However if the fluids are in equilibrium with \ncrystalline rocks, lower pH can be achieved and therefore, \nmore reduced sulfur and higher metal contents are possible. In \nthis case, sedimentary brines in crystalline basement rocks that \nascend into carbonate cover rocks, can precipitate metal in suf-\nficient quantities through cooling and change in pH.\nFluid-Drive Mechanisms\nThe fluid-drive mechanisms proposed for MVT depos-\nits are numerous and include topography-driven, sediment \ncompaction, orogenic squeezing, overpressured gas reservoirs, \nand thermal and density reflux drives.

Dissolution-collapse breccias are typically \ncomplex multistage breccias consisting of ore-stage hydro-\nthermal dissolution with selective replacement textures that \nare superimposed on pre-ore breccias. The complex interplay \nbetween sulfide deposition, acid generation, and hydrothermal \nbrecciation with pre-ore carbonate dissolution features is \ndiscussed by Leach and others (2003). In nearly all MVT \ndistricts, preexisting solution-collapse breccias and related \ncarbonate-dissolution features provide high permeability \nzones that facilitate effective fluid mixing and ore deposi-\ntion. These may be pre-ore solution-collapse features that are \ncommonly located beneath an unconformity or disconformity, \nsuggesting they originated by subaerial karstification. Alter-\nnatively the pre-ore dissolution features may be the result of \nhydrothermal dissolution independent of sulfide deposition.",

The lack of speleothems and other cave features \nin MVT ore breccias is commonly argued for hydrothermal \ndissolution brecciation.

This uniquely \nradiogenic strontium signature indicates that the responsible \nfluid interacted and flowed through rocks containing potassium-\nrich minerals such as potassium feldspar, muscovite, and \nclays.  For individual deposits, this can be used to trace which \nsedimentary or metamorphic formation had interacting fluids \nthat transported this signature to the site of ore deposition.  \nSystematic decreases in 87Sr/86Sr have been linked to \nfluid-flow direction (Hitzman and others, 1998; Paradis \nand others, 2006).  Lower 87Sr/86Sr typically accompanies \nincreasing \u03b418O down fluid-flow gradient.  This change in \nstrontium values is thought to occur by increasing dilution \nfrom formation waters, mixing with some other fluid, or \nincreased interaction with a cool, nonradiogenic limestone.",
