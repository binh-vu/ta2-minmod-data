Introduction \nOverview\nMagmatic sulfide deposits containing nickel (Ni) and  \ncopper (Cu), with or without (\u00b1) platinum-group elements \n(PGE), account for approximately 60 percent of the world\u2019s \nnickel production (Naldrett, 2004). Most of the remainder of  \nthe Ni production is derived from lateritic deposits, which form \nby weathering of ultramafic rocks in humid tropical conditions \n(Elias, 2002; Freyssinet and others, 2005). Magmatic Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE \nsulfide deposits are spatially and genetically related to bodies of \nmafic and/or ultramafic rocks. The sulfide deposits form when \nthe mantle-derived mafic and/or ultramafic magmas become \nsulfide-saturated and segregate immiscible sulfide liquid, \ncommonly following interaction with continental crustal rocks \n(Arndt and others, 2005).\nDeposits of magmatic Ni-Cu sulfides occur with mafic and/\nor ultramafic bodies emplaced in diverse geologic settings.",

Relatively \nhigh degrees of partial melting of the mantle result in parental \nmagmas enriched in Ni and PGE (Keays, 1995).

Thus, the importance of the country \nrocks that host magmatic Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE deposits lies not in their \nchemical composition but in whether the rocks may contribute \nto sulfur saturation of magma and to the physical controls that \ncountry rocks may exert on intrusion dynamics. \nIn a closed system, fractional crystallization of magma \nwith low sulfur content will produce only a small volume of \nsulfide minerals late in the crystallization sequence.

Keays and Lightfoot \n(2010) compared the unmineralized Deccan flood basalt system \nto the Siberian flood basalts which host the Noril\u2019sk deposits \nand determined that simply having significant crustal contami-\nnation of the magmatic system was not sufficient to produce \nlarge Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE sulfide deposits. Although a wide variety of \nsedimentary and metamorphic rock types may interact with a \nS-undersaturated magma (table 11\u20131), unless a threshold level \nof sulfur is present within the crustal contaminant, the mag-\nmatic system likely will not reach early sulfur saturation and \nproduce significant mineralization (Keays and Lightfoot, 2010).",

Therefore, as the percentage of mantle \nmelting increases above 11 percent, Pt, Pd, and Cu, originally \ncontained in mantle sulfide minerals, are diluted in the melt \nand decrease in concentration, whereas the Ni content, origi-\nnally contained both in mantle sulfide and in olivine, continues \nto increase in the melt.

Some \nof these offsets were attributed to deep crustal-penetrating \nfaults that, according to Rempel (1994), might have served as \nconduits for ore-forming magmas.\nRecent seismic-reflection-profiling studies, such as those \ncoordinated by the Canadian Lithoprobe Project (Clowes, \n2010), have greatly dispelled some of the old prejudices \nregarding seismic applications for mineral deposits in igne-\nous and metamorphic terranes. Recent investigations have \nrevealed that sulfide minerals and their host rocks can have \nlarge contrasts in acoustic impedance (fig. 6\u20135), and that \nmany massive sulfide occurrences should be associated with \ndetectable reflection or diffraction signatures, provided that \nthe seismic data are properly acquired and processed (Salis-\nbury and Snyder, 2007).",

A subsequent extensive microscopic \nstudy of the Sudbury ores by Wandke and Hoffman (1924)  \nalso led them to conclude that the deposits were hydrothermal \nin origin. \nAs noted by Naldrett (2005), arguments about the mag-\nmatic versus hydrothermal origin of the Sudbury ores persisted \nthrough most of the first half of the twentieth century, with \nthose mapping and studying the SIC favoring a magmatic \norigin and those most familiar with the mines favoring a hydro-\nthermal origin.

The migration of residual Cu-rich liquids \nmay be enhanced because, with increasing Cu and decreasing \nsulfur contents, those residual liquids develop strong wetting \nabilities against silicates (Naldrett, 1969). The capacity for \nredistribution of late-stage Cu-rich sulfides is an explanation \nfor the commonly reported occurrence of fractures and brec-\ncias filled with Cu-rich sulfides at many deposits, including \n\u201cUpper Copper Ore\u201d at the Kharaelakh intrusion at Noril\u2019sk \n(Naldrett and others, 1994).

For example, \nin order to achieve large metal enrichments observed in \nthe Noril\u2019sk disseminated sulfides, large R factors (1,000 \nto 10,000) are required (Barnes and Lightfoot, 2005), \nimplying an extremely dynamic, open, magmatic system. \nDroplets of sulfide have a large surface area-to-volume \nratio that promotes scavenging of chalcophile elements as \ndroplets are transported by flowing magma. Once sulfide \ndroplets are deposited in a layer (which would have a low \nsurface area-to-volume ratio), however, the droplets no \nlonger would extract chalcophile elements efficiently from \noverlying silicate melt.",
